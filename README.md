# Learning GOLANG 
# My issue with the Django project was that the framework demanded at least 3-4 people working on it to be able to build, which was discouraging
# I discovered Golang, something similar to Python and lightweight enough for 1-2 people to be able to work on it.

Currently learning it and building a Micro Blogging site to apply what I am learning.
